"""
Given a grid of size n*m, you need to find the number of paths from (1, 1) to (n, m).
You are allowed to move from (x, y) to (x+1, y) and (x, y) to (x, y+1).
The grid may have some blocked cells, represented by 1, and it is not allowed to move to a blocked cell.
An empty cell is represented by 0.

Output Format:

For each test case, print the number of paths modulo 109 + 7.
Constraints
1 ≤ t ≤ 105
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 103
0 ≤ aij ≤ 1
It is guaranteed that the sum of n*m over all test cases does not exceed 106.
