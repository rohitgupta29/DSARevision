"""
Given a grid of size n*m with non-negative integers, you need to find the maximum path sum from (1, 1) to (n, m).
You are allowed to move from (x, y) to (x+1, y) and (x, y) to (x, y+1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ t ≤ 105
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 103
0 ≤ aij ≤ 107
It is guaranteed that the sum of n*m over all test cases does not exceed 106.
